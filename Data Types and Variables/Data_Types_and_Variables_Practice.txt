Activity 1: Define a variable num with value 100 of integer data type
  num = 100

Activity 2. Define a variable score with value 100 of float data type
  score = 100.0

Activity 3. Define a variable name with your name of string data type.
  name = "Keerthana B"

Activity 4. Identify data type of variable result
  a = 42
  b = "42"
  c = 42.0

  result = a + int(b) + c
  
  print(type(result))
  <class 'float'>


Activity 5. Simple Arithmetic with Numeric Types
Write a Python code to perform addition of two integers num1 = 10 and num2 = 20. Store the final sum in variable result. Also find the data type of the result.

  num1 = 10
  num2 = 20
  result = num1+num2
  print(result)
  print(type(result))
  30
  <class 'int'>


Activity 6. Convert to Upper case
Write a code to convert all character of given text into upper-case. Store result in variable text_upper.

Hello, I am Datawars. I help users to learn Data Science

  text = "Hello, I am Datawars. I help users to learn Data Science"
  text_upper = text.upper()
  print(text_upper)
  HELLO, I AM DATAWARS. I HELP USERS TO LEARN DATA SCIENCE


Activity 7. Convert to Lower case
Write a code to convert all character of given text into lower-case. Store the result in variable text_lower.

PYTHON IS A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

  text = "PYTHON IS A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE"
  text_lower = text.lower()
  print(text_lower)
  python is a programming language


Activity 8. String Concatenation
Write a Python code to concatenate the strings first_name as Alice and last_name as Brown. Don't forget to give a space in between first name and last name. Store the full name in variable full_name.

  first_name = "Alice"
  last_name = "Brown"
  
  full_name = first_name +" "+ last_name
  print(full_name)
  Alice Brown


Activity 9. Type Conversion and Arithmetic
Write a Python code to take a float percentage as 85.5, convert it to an integer, and then add 10 to it. Store the final output in a variable result.

  a = 85.5
  b = int(a)
  c = b + 10
  result = c
  print(c)
  95


Activity 10. Multi-line String Representation
Write a Python code to declare a variable student_info and assign it a multi-line string containing the student’s name as Alice, ID is 101, and score is 90. Print the variable student_info.

  student_info = """Name: Alice
  ID: 101
  Score: 90"""
  
  print(student_info)
  Name: Alice
  ID: 101
  Score: 90


Activity 11. Boolean Operation
Write a Python code to declare two boolean variables attended_classes as True and submitted_assignment as False. Use the and operator to check if both are True. Store the value in variable result.

  attended_classes = True
  submitted_assignment = False
  result = (attended_classes and submitted_assignment) == True
  print(result)
  False


Activity 12. String Indexing and Slicing
Write a Python code to declare a string student_name as Alice. Store the first character and the last three characters of the string in variables first_char and last_three_chars respectively.

  student_name = "Alice"
  first_char = student_name[0]
  last_three_chars = student_name[2:]
  print(first_char)
  print(last_three_chars)
  A
  ice


Activity 13. Reverse a String
Write a Python code to reverse the string student_name as Alice and print the reversed name. Store the result in variable reversed_name.

  student_name = "Alice"
  reversed_name = student_name[::-1]
  print(reversed_name)
  ecilA


Activity 14. Sum of Digits of a Student ID
Write a Python code to calculate the sum of the digits of a student’s ID (student_id = 123). Store the result in variable digit_sum.

  student_id = 123
  digit_sum = 0
  for i in str(student_id):
      digit_sum += int(i)
  print(digit_sum)
  6


Activity 15. Compute Final Score
Write a Python code to calculate the final score of a student by taking their exam_score as 90 and assignment_score as 40. Multiply the exam_score by 0.6 and the assignment_score by 0.4, then add them together. Store the result in variable final_score.

  exam_score = 90  
  assignment_score = 40
  a = exam_score*0.6
  b = assignment_score*0.4
  
  final_score = a+b
  print(final_score)
  70.0
