Extracting Insights from Customer Data

Suppose you have a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a customer's data. Each dictionary has the following keys: name, age, orders. The orders key contains a list of order IDs.

customer_data = [
    {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'orders': [101, 103, 105]},
    {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25, 'orders': [102, 104]},
    {'name': 'Charlie', 'age': 28, 'orders': [106]}
]
Write a function get_total_orders(customer_list) that takes the customer_data list as a parameter and returns the total number of orders across all customers.

You have to write the function in the input box below.

def get_total_orders(customer_list):
    total_orders = 0
    for customer in customer_list:
        total_orders += len(customer['orders'])
    return total_orders

Temperature Data Mapping

A compilation of temperature readings over a week is provided. Each temperature corresponds to a specific day.

temperature_data = [72, 75, 68, 70, 74, 79, 81]
days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']
Expected result looks like below:

temperature_dict = {
    'Monday': 72,
    'Tuesday': 75,
    'Wednesday': 68,
    'Thursday': 70,
    'Friday': 74,
    'Saturday': 79,
    'Sunday': 81
}
Select the appropriate option that generates a dictionary named temperature_dict, associating each day with its respective temperature.


temperature_dict = {}
for i in range(len(temperature_data)):
    temperature_dict[temperature_data[i]] = days[i]

temperature_dict = {}
for i in range(len(days)):
    temperature_dict[days[i]] = temperature_data[i]

temperature_dict = {}
for temp, day in zip(temperature_data, days):
    temperature_dict[temp] = day

temperature_dict = {}
for day, temp in zip(days, temperature_data):
    temperature_dict[day] = temp

ans 
temperature_dict = {}
for i in range(len(days)):
    temperature_dict[days[i]] = temperature_data[i]

temperature_dict = {}
for day, temp in zip(days, temperature_data):
    temperature_dict[day] = temp

    {'product_id': 101, 'name': 'Apple', 'quantity': 50, 'price': 0.5},
    {'product_id': 102, 'name': 'Banana', 'quantity': 30, 'price': 0.3},
    {'product_id': 103, 'name': 'Orange', 'quantity': 40, 'price': 0.4}
]
Craft a function named calculate_total_revenue(inventory) that computes the overall revenue generated by the products in the inventory.

def calculate_total_revenue(inventory):
    total_revenue = 0
    for item in inventory:
        total_revenue += item['quantity'] * item['price']
    return total_revenue

    {'post_id': 103, 'likes': 30, 'comments': 5, 'shares': 2}
]
Opt for the accurate function calculate_engagement_rate(posts) that evaluates the mean engagement rate across all posts. The engagement rate is defined as the total sum of likes, comments, and shares divided by the total number of posts.


def calculate_engagement_rate(posts):
    total_engagement = sum(post['likes'] + post['comments'] + post['shares'] for post in posts)
    avg_engagement_rate = total_engagement / len(posts)
    return avg_engagement_rate

def calculate_engagement_rate(posts):
    total_engagement = sum(post['likes'] + post['comments'] + post['shares'] for post in posts)
    avg_engagement_rate = total_engagement / sum(2 for _ in posts)
    return avg_engagement_rate

def calculate_engagement_rate(posts):
    total_engagement = sum(post['likes'] + post['comments'] + post['shares'] for post in posts)
    avg_engagement_rate = total_engagement / sum(posts)
    return avg_engagement_rate

def calculate_engagement_rate(posts):
    total_engagement = sum(post['likes'] + post['comments'] + post['shares'] for post in posts)
    avg_engagement_rate = total_engagement // len(posts)
    return avg_engagement_rate

Product Inventory

You are managing a product inventory for an online store. Each product's information is represented as a dictionary with product_id, name, price, and quantity keys.

products = [
    {'product_id': 1, 'name': 'Laptop', 'price': 1000, 'quantity': 10},
    {'product_id': 2, 'name': 'Phone', 'price': 800, 'quantity': 15},
    {'product_id': 3, 'name': 'Tablet', 'price': 400, 'quantity': 20}
]
Choose correct option that calculate the total value of the inventory (sum of price * quantity for each product).


inventory_value = sum(product['price'] * product['quantity'] for product in products)

inventory_value = 0
for product in products:
    inventory_value += product['price']
    inventory_value *= product['quantity']

inventory_value = 0
for i in range(len(products)):
    inventory_value += products[i]['price'] * products[i]['quantity']

inventory_value = 0
for product in products:
    inventory_value += product['price'] * product['quantity']
ans

inventory_value = 0
for product in products:
    inventory_value += product['price'] * product['quantity']
inventory_value = sum(product['price'] * product['quantity'] for product in products)
inventory_value = 0
for i in range(len(products)):
    inventory_value += products[i]['price'] * products[i]['quantity']

Nested Dictionary Manipulation

A nested dictionary is employed to capture student information, encompassing name, age, and grades.

students = {
    'Alice': {'age': 20, 'grades': [85, 92, 78]},
    'Bob': {'age': 21, 'grades': [92, 88, 90]},
    'Charlie': {'age': 19, 'grades': [78, 80, 75]},
    'Chaplien': {'age': 34, 'grades': [90, 90, 90]}
}
Choose the appropriate options that execute the computation of the average grade for each student and subsequently organize this data within a new dictionary.

The resultant structure is as follows:

average_grades = {
    'Alice': 85.0,
    'Bob': 90.0,
    'Charlie': 77.66666666666667,
    'Chaplien': 90.0
}

average_grades = {}
for student, info in students.items():
    total_grades = 0
    for grade in info['grades']:
        total_grades += grade
    average_grades[student] = total_grades / len(students)

average_grades = {}
for student, info in students.items():
    grades_sum = sum(info['grades'])
    average_grades[student] = grades_sum / len(info['grades'])

average_grades = {}
for student, info in students.items():
    total_grades = 0
    for grade in info['grades']:
        total_grades += grade
    average_grades[student] = total_grades / len(info['grades'])

average_grades = {}
for student in students:
    info = students[student]
    grades_sum = sum(info['grades'])
    average_grades[student] = grades_sum / len(info['grades'])
ans

average_grades = {}
for student, info in students.items():
    grades_sum = sum(info['grades'])
    average_grades[student] = grades_sum / len(info['grades'])
average_grades = {}
for student in students:
    info = students[student]
    grades_sum = sum(info['grades'])
    average_grades[student] = grades_sum / len(info['grades'])
average_grades = {}
for student, info in students.items():
    total_grades = 0
    for grade in info['grades']:
        total_grades += grade
    average_grades[student] = total_grades / len(info['grades'])

User Message Summary

You're a Data Scientist at Slack, and your task is to process messages for conversations between users. The messages are given in the format of a list of dictionaries.

messages = [
    {'from': 'santiago', 'to': 'anurag', 'message': 'Hello world', 'is_read': False},
    {'from': 'martin', 'to': 'santiago', 'message': 'How are you', 'is_read': False},
    {'from': 'santiago', 'to': 'anurag', 'message': 'Good Morning', 'is_read': False},
    {'from': 'santiago', 'to': 'anurag', 'message': 'How are you', 'is_read': True},
    {'from': 'anurag', 'to': 'santiago', 'message': "I'm fine", 'is_read': False},
    {'from': 'anurag', 'to': 'martin', 'message': "How are you", 'is_read': False}
    # ...
]
Your goal is to generate a summary for each user that includes the total number of messages and the number of unread messages they have received. Which code correctly generates the desired summary?

The generated summary looks like below:

user_summary = {'anurag': {'total_messages': 3, 'unread': 2},
 'santiago': {'total_messages': 2, 'unread': 2},
 'martin': {'total_messages': 1, 'unread': 1}}


user_summary = {}
for message in messages:
    user = message['from']
    user_summary.setdefault(user, {'total_messages': 0, 'unread': 0})
    if not message['is_read']:
        user_summary[user]['unread'] += 1
    user_summary[user]['total_messages'] += 1

user_summary = {}
for message in messages:
    user = message['from']
    if user not in user_summary:
        user_summary[user] = {'total_messages': 1, 'unread': 1}
    else:
        user_summary[user]['total_messages'] += 1
        if not message['is_read']:
            user_summary[user]['unread'] += 1

user_summary = {}
for message in messages:
    receiver = message['to']
    if receiver not in user_summary:
        user_summary[receiver] = {'total_messages': 0, 'unread': 0}
    user_summary[receiver]['total_messages'] += 1
    if not message['is_read']:
        user_summary[receiver]['unread'] += 1

user_summary = {}
for message in messages:
    user = message['to']
    if user in user_summary:
        user_summary[user]['total_messages'] += 1
        if not message['is_read']:
            user_summary[user]['unread'] += 1
    else:
        user_summary[user] = {'total_messages': 1, 'unread': 1}
        if not message['is_read']:
            user_summary[user]['unread'] += 1
ans

user_summary = {}
for message in messages:
    receiver = message['to']
    if receiver not in user_summary:
        user_summary[receiver] = {'total_messages': 0, 'unread': 0}
    user_summary[receiver]['total_messages'] += 1
    if not message['is_read']:
        user_summary[receiver]['unread'] += 1

Employee Salary Calculation

You are working on a payroll system to calculate employee salaries. Each employee's information is represented as a dictionary with employee_id, name, hours_worked, and hourly_rate keys.

employees = [
    {'employee_id': 101, 'name': 'Alice', 'hours_worked': 40, 'hourly_rate': 20},
    {'employee_id': 102, 'name': 'Bob', 'hours_worked': 35, 'hourly_rate': 18},
    {'employee_id': 103, 'name': 'Charlie', 'hours_worked': 45, 'hourly_rate': 22}
]
Complete the below solution to calculate the correct salaries of each employee.

salaries = {}
for employee in employees:
    employee_id = employee['employee_id']
    salary = ... # Calculate correct salary
    salaries[employee_id] = salary
Calculated salaries look like below:

salaries = {
    101: 800,
    102: 630,
    103: 990
}
ans
salaries = {}
for employee in employees:
    employee_id = employee['employee_id']
    salary = employee['hours_worked'] * employee['hourly_rate']
    salaries[employee_id] = salary

Task Completion Progress

You are tracking the progress of tasks in a project. Each task's information is represented as a dictionary with task_id, description, status, and completed_percent keys.

tasks = [
    {'task_id': 1, 'description': 'Design', 'status': 'In Progress', 'completed_percent': 30},
    {'task_id': 2, 'description': 'Development', 'status': 'In Progress', 'completed_percent': 50},
    {'task_id': 3, 'description': 'Testing', 'status': 'Completed', 'completed_percent': 100}
]
Identify and correct the mistake in the provided below solution to properly identify incomplete tasks that are in progress.

incomplete_tasks = []
for task in tasks:
    if task['status'] == 'In Progress' and task['completed_percent'] >= 100:
        incomplete_tasks.append(task['description'])

incomplete_tasks = []
for task in tasks:
    if task['status'] == 'In Progress' and task['completed_percent'] < 100:
        incomplete_tasks.append(task['description'])

ans
incomplete_tasks = []
for task in tasks:
    if task['status'] == 'In Progress' and task['completed_percent'] < 100:
        incomplete_tasks.append(task['description'])
In the provided solution, the condition to identify incomplete tasks should use < 100 instead of >= 100 to account for tasks that are still in progress but not fully completed.

User Activity Tracking

You are analyzing user activity data for a social media platform. Each user's activity is represented as a dictionary with user_id, posts, likes, and comments keys.

user_activity = [
    {'user_id': 101, 'posts': 5, 'likes': 20, 'comments': 10},
    {'user_id': 102, 'posts': 3, 'likes': 15, 'comments': 5},
    {'user_id': 103, 'posts': 8, 'likes': 25, 'comments': 15}
]
Write code to calculate the total engagement (likes + comments) for each user and store it in a new dictionary named user_engagement.

Output look like below:

user_engagement = {
    101: 30,
    102: 20,
    103: 40
}

user_engagement = {}
for user in user_activity:
    user_engagement[user['user_id']] = user['likes'] + user['comments']
ans
user_engagement = {}
for user in user_activity:
    user_engagement[user['user_id']] = user['likes'] + user['comments']
17
User Account Management

You are building a user account management system. Each user's account information is represented as a dictionary with user_id, username, email, and is_active keys.

user_accounts = [
    {'user_id': 101, 'username': 'alice123', 'email': 'alice@example.com', 'is_active': True},
    {'user_id': 102, 'username': 'bob456', 'email': 'bob@example.com', 'is_active': False},
    {'user_id': 103, 'username': 'charlie789', 'email': 'charlie@example.com', 'is_active': True}
]
Choose correct option that create a list of usernames for active users.

The expected list looks like below:

active_usernames = ['alice123', 'charlie789']

active_usernames = []
for user in user_accounts:
    if not user['is_active']:
        active_usernames.append(user['username'])
active_usernames

active_usernames = [user['username'] for user in user_accounts if user['is_active']]

active_usernames = []
for i in range(len(user_accounts)):
    if user_accounts[i]['is_active']:
        active_usernames.append(user_accounts[i]['username'])

active_usernames = []
for user in user_accounts:
    if user['is_active']:
        active_usernames.append(user['username'])
ans

active_usernames = []
for user in user_accounts:
    if user['is_active']:
        active_usernames.append(user['username'])
active_usernames = [user['username'] for user in user_accounts if user['is_active']]
active_usernames = []
for i in range(len(user_accounts)):
    if user_accounts[i]['is_active']:
        active_usernames.append(user_accounts[i]['username'])
Explanation: The provided solution iterates over each user account and appends the username to the active_usernames list if the user account is active.
