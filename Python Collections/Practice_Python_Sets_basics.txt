Union of two sets

We have two sets s1 & s2 defined. Now take the union of set s1 with set s2. Store your answer in the variable s1_union_s2.

Correct
To take the union of two sets s1 and s2 in Python, you can use the union() method or the | operator. The union of two sets returns a new set that contains all the unique elements from both sets.

s1.union(s2)
or

s1_union_s2 = s1 | s2
Both of these methods will create a new set s1_union_s2that contains all the unique elements from both s1 and s2.

2
Intersection of two sets

Now take the intersection of set s1 and set s2. Store your answer in the variable s1_intersection_s2.

Correct
To take the intersection of two sets s1 and s2 in Python, you can use the intersection() method or the & operator. The intersection of two sets returns a new set that contains the elements that are common to both sets.

s1_intersection_s2=s1.intersection(s2)
s1_intersection_s2 = s1 & s2
Both of these methods will create a new set s1_intersection_s2 that contains the elements that are present in both s1 and s2. It includes only the elements that are common to both sets.

3
Difference of two sets

We have two sets s1 & s2 defined. Take the difference of set s2 from set s1. Store your answer in the variable s1_difference_s2.

Short explanation for set difference
The set difference operation in this context refers to finding the elements that are present in s1 but not in s2. In other words, it calculates the elements that are unique to s1 and excludes any elements that are also present in s2. As visualized in the Venn Diagram:
set difference

Correct
To perform the set difference operation in Python, you can use the - operator or the difference() method. Here's how you can calculate the difference of s2 from s1 and store it in the variable s1_difference_s2:

s1.difference(s2)
or we can also use the - operator for set difference like the solution below:

s1_difference_s2 = s1 - s2
After executing this code, s1_difference_s2 will contain the elements that are in s1 but not in s2.

Is the set s1 a subset of the set s2.


True


False

Correct

5
Symmetric difference of two sets

Let's take the symmetric difference of set s1 from set s2. And store the answer in the variable s2_symmetric_difference_s1.

Short explanation for symmetric difference of two sets
The symmetric difference operation on sets calculates the elements that are present in either s1 or s2, but not in both. In other words, it excludes the elements that are common to both sets.

Correct
To take the symmetric difference of two sets s1 and s2 in Python, you can use the symmetric_difference() method or the ^ operator. The symmetric difference of two sets returns a new set that contains the elements that are present in either of the sets, but not in both.

s2_symmetric_difference_s1=s1.symmetric_difference(s2)
s2_symmetric_difference_s1=s_symmetric_difference = s1 ^ s2
Both of these methods will create a new set s2_symmetric_difference_s1 that contains the elements that are present in either s1 or s2, but not in both sets. It excludes the elements that are common to both sets.

6
Length of a set

What will be the length of set created from the elements {2,3,4,5,5,3,9,0,1,2}.

7
Correct
s1={2,3,4,5,5,3,9,0,1,2}
len(s1)
7
Indexing on set

Can we use indices on set to find elements at different positions?

Try running:

s1 = {1,2,3,4,5,6,0,9,8,7}
s1[0] # try getting the first element of the set
s1[-1] # try getting the last element 

No, it will gives Error: python TypeError: 'set' object is not subscriptable


Yes, Output: s1[0] gives 1


Yes, Output: s1[-1] gives 1

Correct
No, you cannot index elements in a set in Python because sets are unordered collections of unique elements. This means that the elements in a set are not stored in a specific order, and therefore cannot be accessed by their index position.

s1 = {1,2,3,4,5,6,0,9,8,7}
s1[0]

Number of elements in the set

Find the number of capitals in the set.

149
Correct
len(world_capitals)
9
Add elements to the set

Add a new capital Ankara to the set world_capitals

Correct
world_capitals.add('Ankara')

10
Remove an element from the set

Remove the capital Cairo from the set world_capitals

Correct
world_capitals.remove('Cairo')
world_capitals
11
Add more than one elements to a set

Add two more capitals Delhi and London to the set world_capitals

Important: Try to add both of them at onces, instead of adding them separately using .add() method.

Correct
world_capitals |= {'Delhi', 'London'}
world_capitals
12
Perform membership checks and answer which capitals are part of the set

Which of the following capitals are in the set world_capitals


Paris


Rome


London


Dublin

Correct
print('Rome' in world_capitals)
print('London' in world_capitals)
print('Paris' in world_capitals)
print('Dublin' in world_capitals)

13
Sort the languages in the set popular_languages in descending mode

Sort the elements in popular_languages in descending mode and store them in the variable sorted_langs, which will be a list. The result will look something like:

>>> print(sorted_lang)
['Swift',
 'Ruby',
 'R',
 'Python',
 ...
 'C++',
 'C#']
Correct
The sorted function can be applied to different collections, including sets. By default, it'll sort the elements in ascending mode. The reverse parameter switches to descending mode:

sorted_langs = sorted(popular_languages, reverse=True)
14
